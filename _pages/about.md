My personal website
======
A master’s student at the entomology department. I work at the Krishnan’s lab. We do pesticide toxicity studies, risk assessment and use adverse outcome pathway to understand the effect of pesticides. I undertake toxicity bioassays and residue analysis for samples taking from the field.
